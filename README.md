# Phonebook

## Introduction

This is a simple full stack React application which provides a solid starting point for [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications. Client side code and the backend API is written using Express.

Phonebook is an application made to store names and telephone number of friends, family, or other people we recognize.

## Before You Begin

Before you begin i recommend you to read about the basic building blocks that assemble this application:
* ReactJS - React's [Official Website](https://reactjs.org/) is a great starting point.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through it's [Official Website](https://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics.
* Sequelize - Get in-depth information about Sequelize on the [Official Website](https://sequelize.org/) to learn the [Core Concept](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/category/core-concepts/) of Sequelize.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) which should get you going with the Node.js platform.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
