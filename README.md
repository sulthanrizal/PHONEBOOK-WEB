# Phonebook

## Introducti

This is a simple full stack React application which provides a solid starting point for [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) based applications. Client side code and the backend API is written using Express.

Phonebook is an application made to store names and telephone number of friends, family, or other people we recognize.
